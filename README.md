How to Get Started
To make a move, the player will use a single mouse click to mark a space. In this version, there is no provision to undo a move. Once a move is made, the game proceeds to the next player's turn.
At each move, the game will indicate whose turn (Player A or Player B) it is. When the game ends, it displays one of the following outcomes:
1.Winner: Player A
2.Winner: Player B
3.Draw
